Here's the **summary of the Re-Center Embeddings approach** and a **Python implementation** based on existing transformer models. I'll also outline how we can **test this approach using open-source RAG benchmarks (BEIR, MTEB)** and discuss **how to incorporate explicit direction separation.**

## **Re-Center Embeddings for Improved Retrieval in RAG**
### **What Is Re-Centering Embeddings?**
Re-Center Embeddings is a method for improving retrieval in **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and search systems by dynamically adjusting the embedding space **relative to the query** instead of relying on a static, global similarity measure.

Instead of retrieving documents using a fixed embedding space, we **shift all embeddings by subtracting the query vector**, effectively making the query the new origin. This allows us to **prioritize relevance based on contextual meaning**, making retrieval more **adaptive and precise**.

---

### **Why Is This Approach Useful?**
‚úÖ **More Contextual Retrieval:** Adjusts similarity based on **query meaning** rather than just raw distance.  
‚úÖ **Better Disambiguation:** Helps separate different meanings of ambiguous terms (e.g., "bank" as finance vs. "bank" as nature).  
‚úÖ **Improved Multi-Hop Search:** Each follow-up question dynamically re-centers embeddings to **focus on relevant aspects**.  
‚úÖ **Low Latency & Real-Time:** Uses simple vector subtraction, making it efficient for **real-time search and retrieval.**  
‚úÖ **Works with Existing Models:** No need for retraining‚Äîworks directly with **existing sentence transformers.**  

---

### **How to Implement It**
The best approach for real-time applications is:

1. **Obtain the query embedding** (using a sentence transformer).
2. **Retrieve an initial candidate set using Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)** for efficiency.
3. **Re-center embeddings by subtracting the query vector** from all candidate embeddings.
4. **Re-rank results based on cosine similarity** in the re-centered space.

This balances **efficiency (ANN filtering) and accuracy (re-centering for contextual similarity).**

---

### **Has This Been Done Before?**
While **query expansion and hybrid BM25 + dense retrieval methods exist**, explicit **re-centering of embeddings during retrieval is not a common approach** in RAG.  

Some related methods:
- **Query Expansion & Adaptive Retrieval:** Expanding the search query using LLMs but without shifting embedding spaces.
- **Re-Ranking & Hybrid Search (BM25 + Dense Retrieval):** Improves ranking but doesn‚Äôt **dynamically re-center embeddings.**
- **Conversational Context in RAG:** Some retrieval models adjust based on prior queries, but they **do not explicitly re-center embeddings.**

üöÄ **This approach offers a novel optimization for retrieval by ensuring that query-dependent relationships are emphasized dynamically.**

---

## **Python Implementation of Re-Center Embeddings**
This implementation uses **sentence transformers (SBERT)** and **FAISS (ANN retrieval)** for efficiency.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Load a pre-trained sentence transformer model
model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

# Example corpus (documents to search in)
documents = [
    "Tesla Model 3 is an electric car.",
    "A dishwasher cleans dishes automatically.",
    "The Tesla Model S is a luxury electric vehicle.",
    "Fast sports cars are expensive.",
    "Electric vehicles help reduce carbon emissions."
]

# Compute document embeddings
doc_embeddings = model.encode(documents, normalize_embeddings=True)
dimension = doc_embeddings.shape[1]

# Create FAISS index for fast approximate nearest neighbor search
index = faiss.IndexFlatIP(dimension)
index.add(doc_embeddings)

# Query
query = "Fast electric cars"
query_embedding = model.encode([query], normalize_embeddings=True)

# Retrieve top-k initial results using ANN
k = 3  # Number of neighbors to retrieve
_, top_k_indices = index.search(query_embedding, k)

# Extract relevant embeddings
retrieved_embeddings = doc_embeddings[top_k_indices[0]]

# Step 3: Re-Center embeddings by subtracting the query embedding
recentered_embeddings = retrieved_embeddings - query_embedding

# Step 4: Compute cosine similarity in the re-centered space
cosine_similarities = np.sum(recentered_embeddings * recentered_embeddings, axis=1)

# Rank results based on adjusted similarity
ranked_indices = np.argsort(-cosine_similarities)

# Print the final ranked documents
print("Final Ranked Results:")
for idx in ranked_indices:
    print(f"{documents[top_k_indices[0][idx]]} (Score: {cosine_similarities[idx]:.4f})")
```

## **How to Test This on Open-Source RAG Benchmarks (BEIR, MTEB)?**
We should test **Re-Center Embeddings** using **BEIR** or **MTEB**, which provide benchmarks for evaluating retrieval methods.

### **Testing with BEIR**
1. **Use BEIR's pre-built datasets** (MS MARCO, TREC-COVID, etc.).
2. **Replace the default retrieval method** with our **Re-Center Embeddings approach**.
3. **Measure ranking quality** (MRR, NDCG) before and after re-centering.

Example:
```bash
pip install beir
```
Then modify retrieval in BEIR‚Äôs benchmark code to use **query re-centering before ranking**.

### **Testing with MTEB (Massive Text Embedding Benchmark)**
1. **Use an MTEB retrieval task (like NQ or MSMARCO).**
2. **Apply re-centering before re-ranking.**
3. **Compare results against standard retrieval baselines.**

## **Explicit Direction Separation ‚Äì Handling Functionally Different But Semantically Close Terms**
Re-Center Embeddings works **globally**, but **explicit direction separation** ensures functionally distinct terms (e.g., "washing machine" vs. "dryer") are **separated along meaningful axes**.

### **How Would We Incorporate This?**
1. **Learn Key Axes for Functional Distinctions**
   - Train models to **identify distinguishing features** (e.g., "cleaning" vs. "drying").
   - Learn from datasets where **functionally different words are explicitly labeled.**

2. **Compute Explicit Directional Vectors**
   - Define a **separation vector** based on functional difference:
     \[
     V_{\text{function}} = \text{embedding}(\text{"washing machine"}) - \text{embedding}(\text{"dryer"})
     \]
   - Use contrastive learning to **amplify separation**.

3. **Modify Retrieval to Penalize Overlapping Terms**
   - When retrieving documents, apply **a penalty for functionally different but semantically close terms**.
