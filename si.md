# Key Principles of the Self-Extension Workflow

The **Self-Extension Workflow** is designed to enable agents to autonomously identify, generate, test, and integrate new capabilities in a secure and controlled manner. This feature focuses on combining autonomy with rigorous validation to ensure safety and reliability.

---

## **Key Principles**

### 1. **Autonomy**
Agents can:
- Assess their current capabilities and identify gaps during task execution.
- Propose new features or integrations to fill those gaps.

### 2. **Safety**
- Generated code is sandboxed and tested in isolated environments.
- Agents are restricted to controlled resources (e.g., limited cloud VM instances or CI/CD pipelines).

### 3. **Validation**
- All proposed changes undergo a strict testing and validation process.
- A pull request (PR) workflow ensures multi-level review before merging.

### 4. **Control**
- Access controls and predefined workflows limit what agents can modify or create.
- Generated changes are version-controlled and subject to review.

### 5. **Traceability**
- All actions (e.g., feature requests, code generation, test results) are logged for auditing and accountability.

## **Workflow**

### Step 1: Capability Assessment
Agents assess their current capabilities during task execution and identify missing functionalities.

#### Code Example
```python
def assess_capability(agent, query):
    reasoning = agent.reason(query)
    if "NEED_INTEGRATION" in reasoning:
        return reasoning.split("NEED_INTEGRATION:")[1].strip()
    return None
```

---

### Step 2: Code Generation
The agent generates the code required to implement the missing feature.

#### Code Example
```python
def generate_code(agent, feature_request):
    prompt = f"Generate Python code for {feature_request}."
    return agent.reason(prompt)
```

---

### Step 3: Testing in Sandbox
Generated code is tested in a secure environment. This can be done using:
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD testing.
- **Cloud VMs** with restricted resources and permissions.

#### Example: GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Test Generated Code

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - feature/*

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'
    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run Tests
      run: pytest tests/
```

#### Example: Using Cloud VMs
Provision a cloud VM, execute the generated code, and capture test results in isolation.

---

### Step 4: Pull Request Submission
If tests pass, the agent submits a pull request with the new feature for review.

#### Code Example
```python
def submit_pull_request(agent, branch_name, feature_description):
    pr_payload = {
        "title": f"Add {feature_description}",
        "body": "This PR implements the requested feature.",
        "head": branch_name,
        "base": "main"
    }
    return github_api.create_pull_request(pr_payload)
```

---

### Step 5: Review and Validation
The PR is reviewed by a higher-level agent or human. Validation includes:
- Running static analysis tools.
- Validating functionality in a staging environment.

---

### Step 6: Deployment
Once approved, the code is merged, and the new capability becomes available to the agent.

#### Code Example
```python
def integrate_new_feature(agent, feature_name):
    agent.request_tool(feature_name)  # Dynamically load the new feature
```

## **Open Questions**

### 1. How to Ensure Robust Security?
- How can we prevent generated code from accessing sensitive resources or performing unauthorized actions?
- What sandboxing strategies should we use to contain potential harm?

### 2. How to Handle Failures?
- What should the agent do if the generated code fails during testing?
- Should there be a fallback mechanism to retry or refine the generated code?

### 3. Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Should feature proposals and reviews involve multiple agents for consensus?
- How can agents communicate effectively during the PR review process?

### 4. Performance Overhead
- How do we minimize the latency introduced by rigorous testing and validation?
- Can we optimize resource usage for sandbox environments (e.g., reusing VMs or CI/CD runners)?

### 5. User Control
- Should human oversight always be required for merging PRs?
- How do we balance autonomy with user intervention in the workflow?

## **Next Steps**
1. Prototype a simple self-extension workflow using GitHub Actions for testing.
2. Define security constraints for sandbox environments.
3. Implement logging and monitoring for full traceability.
4. Experiment with multi-agent collaboration for feature proposals and reviews.
